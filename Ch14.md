X window system was developed in 1980s. It is the core insfrastructure behind the desktop. You can edit, add and remove applications as you want. X window system is like the kernel. There is X server and X clients. X clients will communicate with the X server to have all the applications to be placed on the screen. One of the most important service application is Window manager. It figures out how to arrange the windows on the screen and provides interactive decorations such as title bars that allow user to move and minimize windows. Widgets are desktop applications/icons appears on the screen. You can add and remove the icons as you like to. Some applications need desktop environments to support the appearance. Applications such as web broswers are at the top of the desktop. Some applications require Desktop Bus to serve as an interprocess communication mechanism that allow applications to talk with each other. X server runs on a virtual terminal(vty0 and such). If there are multiple X sessions open, it will display as 0:0, 0:1 and on. You can start an X session using startx or xinit command(however when I type in the commands, I get an error messege saying /usr/lib/xorg/Xorg.wrap: Only console users are allowed to run the X server). X clients and X server can communicate over a network via TCP port 6000. There is a drawback because datas cannot be encrypt and it is insecure. You can turn off the server to not listening to TCP port 6000 by typing -nolisten tcp command. You can view the location of an application by typing xwininfo and clock on the application or icon you wish to click, it will shows you the client window ID, where is the X client is in the window, the color for the client. You can also view all the window IDs and clients using then xlsclients -l command. You can check for X client events using xev command and click on one of the application. It will display the location of the application on the screen and more. You can remap keys such as Tab, Caps Lock, and Shift of your keyboard in the setting. The X server uses the X Input Extension to manages input from many different devices such as keyboard and pointer (mouse). To use the same type of device (keyboard or mouse), the X server Input Extension creates a "virtual core" device and it is called the master. The physical devices that connected become the slaves. The masters and slaves have each own ID assigned. To view the X Input Extension list, you can use xinput --list command. You can use xsetroot to change the display of your background. For example, the color of your screen. The X window system plays a big roll in our operating system. Although X window has changed over the years, it is not suitable for devices such as smartphones and tablets.

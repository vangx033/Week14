# Week 14 - Support for our project
# As I cannot connect to the server, I did some research on TCP vs UDP because we are using TCP to communite with the server and I believe we use UDP while running the game. 
## SSH 
SSH is stand for Secure Shell. TCP port 2 is assigned to SSH. It was designed to replace Telnet(port 23) and other unsecured protocols. This protocol is used to start the SSH client program that enables secure connection to the SSH server on a remote machine.

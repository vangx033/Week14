C programming language compiler is one of the oldest program. The language executable on most Unix system and called GNU C compiler or gcc. The delevopment process is to write programs, compile them, and run them. You will have to compile the source code into a lower code that the computer can understand. You will need to save your source code in a .c file and run with cc <x>.c command. If your file is too large, you can separate them into a smaller .c files and run each compiled file at a time. Second option is to create a excutable name (myprograms) and compile your source files as .o files. Then you can run your files at once using cc -o myprograms 1stfile.o 2ndfile.o. The C preprocessor is a program that re-write the source code into a form that compiler understand. The command for source code is called directive. There are three basic types of directives. They are all start with # sign. The firt type is called Include file. It use #include to include all files. Second type is called Macro definition. It is to substitute a word (ALL CAPS) with something in your code. For example, #define ME to Xee. Third type is Conditionals. They are #if, #ifnot, #ifdef and #endif. C compiler a C library which is a collection of all the standard(built-in) functions such as math and random in it. In order for a program to run, compilers will have to have all the necessary libraries. Static libraries and shared libraries are the two examples. They are to be linked to a program. They are both have its own advantages and disadvantages. As the static library sizes grow, it will use more disc space and memory which some programmers prefer to use shared library over static. Shared library also has its drawback which it is more harder to manage it.
